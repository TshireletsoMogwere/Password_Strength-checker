**Project Idea: Password Strength Checker**

**Objective:**
Create a web application that checks the strength of a password entered by the user.

**Features:**
1. An input field where the user can enter their password.
2. A button to trigger the password strength check.
3. Display the strength of the password based on certain criteria (e.g., length, presence of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, special characters).
4. Provide feedback to the user indicating whether the password is weak, medium, or strong based on the criteria.
5. Use colors (e.g., red for weak, yellow for medium, green for strong) to visually represent the strength of the password.
6. Optionally, provide suggestions to the user on how to improve the password strength.


**Tips:**
- Break down the password strength criteria into individual checks (e.g., length check, presence of uppercase letters, presence of lowercase letters, presence of numbers, presence of special characters).
- Use regular expressions to perform pattern matching for checking the presence of specific character types.
- Define thresholds for determining weak, medium, and strong passwords based on your chosen criteria.
- Consider providing real-time feedback to the user as they type their password (e.g., changing the color of the strength indicator).

This project will help you improve your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills, as well as deepen your understanding of handling user input and performing validation in web applications.
